# Virtual-Memory-Management-System-in-Xinu-OS

Language: C

Platform: XINU OS

• Extended the x86 based Xinu OS to support a virtual memory system with demand paging and lazy allocation optimizations.

• The implementation exploited a hierarchical page directory structure and emulated disk space with a dedicated portion of the memory.
